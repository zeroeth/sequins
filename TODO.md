- basic pattern sequencer
- bpm
- pattern length
- note length in pattern

- block logic (repeat, skip, probability etc)
- one time logic (shift, transpose, randomize, shuffle)

- other sequence types (flourish, figure, ampfy groovebox patterns, senode, grid music, elysium, zillion, wolftones, polygogo [for automation shapes], bitwig for automation shapes too)
- logic to control independent variables of sequencer instances to start/stop/slow/step eachother (and also midi control to do the same)
